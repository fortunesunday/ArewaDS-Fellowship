# ArewaDS-Fellowship
Welcome to my repository
This Repository serves to track my learning in the ongoing Arewa Data science bootcamp, cohort 3
I am Fortune Richman, female, a student of the faculty of Pharmacy in the University of Uyo with a knack for technology.
I like to think I'm a nerd, LOL. 
looking forward to having a great time here. I am open to collaboration and your input that would be beneficial to my learning process. Thank you.
